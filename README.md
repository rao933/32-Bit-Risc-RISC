# 32-Bit-Risc-RISC

32 - Bit RISC Processor Design

The project report is divided into 9 parts, FI, ADDGEN/RR, FO/Execution, writeback,
register interface, memory interface, data forwarding, stall logic and external interrupts.
The signals generated in the FI are mentioned at the start, but may appear in the later
stages diagrams. The report uses hyper links to jump to the original signal generation
page, however, in hard copy this feature will not be possible to use.

The operator theory of every stage is described, however, the specific heading of
“operation theory” in all the parts is not made.

The microprocessor is little endian. The Stack Pointer convention is that it does post
increment. The signals involved heading in every parts describes the inputs and
outputs, the data passing through every pipeline stage is shown in figures. All the
operations mentioned in the project spreadsheet are covered.

At the end of the report, the memory interface, the data forwarding and stall logic for the
microprocessor is defined. The memory block is used before in the pipeline stages,
however, the complete explanation of the bloch is explained in its dedicated section at
the end.
